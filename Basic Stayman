--- Stayman is used after a notrump bid to look for an 8-card major suit fit. After partner's 1NT opening，2!C asks opener\n\
if he has a 4-card major. Opener responds as follows:\n\
  • 21D - No 4-card major\n\
  • 2!H - 4+!H，may also have 4!S\n\
  • 2!S - 4+!S and less than 4!H\n\
A Stayman 2!C bid normally shows 8+ points; but if the responder is prepared to pass any response，he may have 0 points.\n\
