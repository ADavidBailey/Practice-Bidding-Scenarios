## Better Bidding Practice on BBO

BBO Practice tables are a fantastic resource for practicing bidding, either with a partner or with a robot. But to make the most of it one must know how to program the dealer generator that BBO uses. I have created a new tool called Practice Bidding Scenarios that simplifies this process, providing dozens of canned bidding scenarios, for example. Jacoby Transfers, Smolen, slam bidding after a Stayman response, etc. Practice Bidding Scenarios piggybacks off the BBOalert browser extension to load the necessary dealer code, allowing many bidding scenarios to be selected with the press of a button.

Each of the light blue background are section headers that you may click to expand/collapse the groups of related scenarios.  Clicking a button with a white background will automatically load the dealer constraints for that scenario.
Most of the Scenarios work OK with robots.  Those that don’t, I’ve grouped at the bottom.
I'm excited about the response I’ve received AND, even more so, about this project’s potential. For a while, I struggled with what I wanted from this.  Here’s what I decided:

- I want to make this available as broadly as possible, as soon as possible.  
- I don't want to pursue a trademark, copyright, or patent.
- I don’t want to make money from this.
- I want people to enjoy this.
- I want people to enjoy learning to play better bridge.

I'm 81 years old; I don’t have time to wait!
