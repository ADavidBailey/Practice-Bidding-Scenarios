Button,Jacoby Transfer,\n\
--- A Jacoby Transfer is used to force the NT opener to bid 2!H or 2!S.  The responder bids\n\
the suit directly below the suit he holds.\n\
  • 21D - shows 5+!H\n\
  • 2!H - shows 5+!S\n\
Since transfers do not promise any points，the 1NT opener MUST accept the transfer (by bidding the suit responder has shown)\n\
Responder is in charge and opener does as told.\n\
