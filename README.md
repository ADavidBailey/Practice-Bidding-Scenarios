# Practice-Bidding-Scenarios

With help from my friends, I am developing Practice Bidding Scenarios.  This works on a BBO Practice Table.  A user just clicks a button with the name of the scenario, the constraints are automatically imported to the 'use this code'  at Deal source/Advanced.  A single user can deal and bid these hands with a robot.  A partnership can practice with or without robots.  They can switch among the scenarios, such as Jacoby Transfers, Slam after Stayman, Smolen, Weak 2 Bids, etc.  I even created a whole set of scenarios that correspond to Gavin Wolpert's Major Suit Response Structure.  I've done several others for him.

I'm excited about the response AND the potential.  I'm sharing a document that explains the background.  I'm including a snippet that explains my motivation.

I decided what I want and don’t want:

  - I want to make this available as broadly as possible, as soon as possible.  
  - I don't want to pursue a trademark, copyright, or patent.
  - I don’t want to make money from this.
  - I want people to enjoy this.
  - I want more people to play better bridge.
  - I'm 81 years old; I don’t have time to wait!

I would like your help in promoting this and encouraging users to use it.  This has real potential for helping bridge players learn infrequently bidding problems.
