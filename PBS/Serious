---  Serious/Non-Serious: When we're in a 2/1 auction and we have a major suit fit\n\
and the bid is at 3 of our majorï¼Œthe step bid (or 3N) says I'm non-serious (or serious).\n\
it's a partnership agreement.  I prefer non-serious as it doesn't reveal information.\n\
The deal is leveled so that game and slam occur with about the same frequency.\n\
