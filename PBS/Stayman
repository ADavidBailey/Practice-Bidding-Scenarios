--- Stayman asks the opener to show a 4-card major.\n\
After partner's 1NT opening，2!C asks for a 4-card major. Opener responds as follows:\n\
• 2!D - No 4-card major\n\
• 2!H - 4+!H，may also have 4!S\n\
• 2!S - 4+!S and less than 4!H\n\
Normally，Stayman shows 8+HCP; but，if you're willing to pass anything that your partner\n\
might bid，you may bid 2!C with any strength.\n\
