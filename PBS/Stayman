--- Stayman asks the opener for a 4-card major.  Responses are as follow...\n\
• 2!D - No 4-card major\n\
• 2!H - 4+!H，may also have 4!S\n\
• 2!S - 4+!S and denies 4!H\n\
Normally，Stayman shows 8+HCP; but，if you're willing to pass anything that your\n\
partner might bid，you may bid 2!C with any strength.\n\
