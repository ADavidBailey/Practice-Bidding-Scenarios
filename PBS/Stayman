Button,Stayman,\n\
--- Stayman is used after a notrump bid to look for an 8-card major suit fit or show an invite with 5!S.\n\
After partner's 1NT opening，2!C asks for a 4-card major. Opener responds as follows:\n\
  • 2!D - No 4-card major\n\
  • 2!H - 4+!H，may also have 4!S\n\
  • 2!S - 4+!S and less than 4!H\n\
A Stayman 2!C bid normally shows 8+ points; but if the responder is prepared to pass any response，\n\
(Drop Dead Stayman) or correct 2!D to 2!H showing 4!H AND 4!S (Crawling Stayman)，then responder may have 0 points.\n\
Correcting 2!D or 2!H to 2!S shows an invitational hand (8 or 9 HCP) with 5!S.\n\
