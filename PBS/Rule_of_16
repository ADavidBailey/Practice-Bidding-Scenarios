Button,Rule of 16,\n\
---  North opens 1N with 15-17 HCP and East passes. South has a balanced hand with 8-9 HCP and more than 13 R16 points\n\
(HCP + number of cards higher than an 8).  When South has more than 15 R16 points，South will will have the 4!C;\n\
otherwise，North will have the 4!C.  Sit South and put Robots in the other three seats.  Check Double-Dummy to see\n\
how you did. If you want，you can test with specific R16 values (15，16，17，or 18).  On all of these the opener will\n\
have exactly 15 HCP -- hands that would not accept an invitation.  Let me know how the Rule of 16 works for you.\n\
