--- Reverse By Opener\n\
Reverses show 5+ cards in the first suit and 4+ cards in the suit rebid.  They show\n\
approximately the same strength as rebidding 2N -- about 17+ HCP.  Possible reverses are...\n\
  • 1!H - 1N - 2!S\n\
  • 1!D - 1!S - 2!H\n\
  • 1!D - 1N - 2!H/2!S\n\
  • 1!C - 1!H - 2!D\n\
  • 1!C - 1!S - 2!D/2!H\n\
  • 1!C - 1N - 2!D/2!H/1!S\n\
Reverses are NOT a convention.  If you don't have the extra strength，don't reverse.\n\
