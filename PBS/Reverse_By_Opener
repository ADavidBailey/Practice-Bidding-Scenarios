--- Reverse By Opener\n\
Reverses show 5+ cards in the suit opened and 4+ cards (usually) in the suit rebid.  They are natural\n\
and strong -- in the 17-21 range -- a 1-round force.  Possible Reverses by Opener are...\n\
  • 1!H - 1N - 2!S\n\
  • 1!D - 1!S - 2!H\n\
  • 1!D - 1N - 2!H/2!S\n\
  • 1!C - 1!H - 2!D\n\
  • 1!C - 1!S - 2!D/2!H\n\
  • 1!C - 1N - 2!D/2!H/1!S\n\
Reverses are NOT a convention.  If you don't have the extra strength，don't reverse.  Some play lebensohl\n\
after reverses -- second link below.\n\
