The Notrump Ladder describes the opening sequences for all balanced hands.  These deals，\n\
allow you to explore for slam. The opener wil have a balanced hand.  The responder will\n\
have values to investigate slam.  The pair has no 8-card major or 9-card minor fit.\n\
The hands are leveled so that the first several ranges of NT ladder and the total\n\
hcp -- 31，32，or 33 -- will occur with approximately the same frequency.\n\
