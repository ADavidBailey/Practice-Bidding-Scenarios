An unusual jump is a splinter.\n\
A Jump Reverse is unusual.  Billy Miller refers to these 3-level splinters as 'splimit'.\n\
They're always below the 3-level or responder's suit and they're invitational to game.\n\
https://tinyurl.com/Billy-Miller-SpLimit-Bids\n\
Double jumpshifts are also unusual. They're above the 3-level of responder's suit; thusï¼Œgame forcing.\n\
Many also play that Jump's in 2/1 auctions are splinters. (Not Included Here)\n\
NOTE: The Robots play these 3-level splinters as GAME FORCING.\n\
