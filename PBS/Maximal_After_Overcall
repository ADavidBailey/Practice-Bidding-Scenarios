Button,Maximal Double,\n\
--- Maximal Overcall Double:  After we've bid and raised a major suit\n\
and they compete in the suit just under ours (the Maximal suit) we need\n\
to distinguish between a competitive raise and an invitational raise.\n\
The Maximal Double is the answer:\n\
  • After 1!H (?) 2!H (3!D)，3!H is competitive and X is invitational\n\
  • After 1!S (?) 2!S (3!H)，3!S is competitive and X is invitational\n\
The BBO Robots do NOT play this.\n\
