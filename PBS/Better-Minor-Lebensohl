After 2!D/2!H/2!S，(X)，Pass，\n\
  • A new suit at the 2-level is to play|n\ 
  • 2N is Better Minor Lebensohl，you will pass (0-7) or correct (8+) after partner's response.\n\
  • 3!D shows 5+ cards.  Bidding 2N and correcting partner's 2!C to 2!D shows 8+.\n\
  • 3 of the other major，shows 4+ cards and 0-7 HCP.  With 8+，bid 2N and correct to 3OM.\n\
