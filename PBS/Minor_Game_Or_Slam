--- Minor Suit Game or Slam\n\
After a Minor Suit.  Minorwood is one of the tools you may need.  A jump raise\n\
to 4 of the minor is Minorwood.  The step responses are as follows:\n\
    • 1st: 1/4 Keycards\n\
    • 2nd: 0/3 Keycards\n\
    • 3rd: 2 Keycards\n\
    • 4th: 2Keycards + Queen of trump\n\
As the linked article explains，RKC Minorwood can be extended to other situations\n\
where the 4m bid cannot be construed as competitive.\n\
