# Opponents 2-suited overcalls

# Define good suits
GoodS = spades(west)>4 and top5(west,spades)>2
GoodH = hearts(west)>4 and top5(west,hearts)>2
GoodD = diamonds(west)>4 and top5(west,diamonds)>2
GoodC = clubs(west)>4 and top5(west,clubs)>2

# Intervener is 2-suited -- all require at least QJT; so, at least 6 HCP for the intervener 
SH = (GoodS and GoodH)
SD = (GoodS and GoodD)
SC = (GoodS and GoodC)
HD = (GoodH and GoodD)
HC = (GoodH and GoodC)
DC = (GoodD and GoodC)

# Intervener's 2-Suits -- NOT opener's suit
oneS = oS and (HD or HC or DC)  // Michaels, Michaels/Top&Bottom, Unusual NT
oneH = oH and (SD or SC or DC)  // Michaels, Michaels/Top&Bottom, Unusual NT
oneD = oD and (SH or SC or HC)  // Michaels, Top&Bottom, Unusual NT
oneC = oC and (SH or SD or HD)  // Michaels, Top&Bottom, Unusual NT

oSuit = (oneS or oneH or oneD or oneC) and shape(south,any xxxx-8xxx-7xxx-6xxx)
oRange = hcp(south)>11 and hcp(south)<22

# West is weak or strong, 6-11 or 15-19
iWeak   = losers(west)<8 and hcp(west)>5  and hcp(west)<12
iStrong = losers(west)<5 and hcp(west)>14 and hcp(west)<20
iRange = iWeak or iStrong

# Responder's minimum HCP
rRange = hcp(north)>6

### Now do it
oSuit and oRange and iRange and rRange

# You might play with chosing west's suits
#and SC or SD  // If you just want the problematic ones

#  Michaels Cue Bid (MCB), Unusual 2NT (U2N), Top & Bottom Cue Bid (T&B)
