Button,Reverse After 2/1,\n\
--- Reverse After 2/1 is for those that don't play 2/1 GF\n\
Reverses show 5+ cards in the suit opened and 4+ cards in the suit rebid.  They are\n\
natural and Game Forcing.  Possible Reverses After 2/1 are...\n\
• 1!D - 2!C - 2!D - 2!H\n\
• 1!D - 2!C - 2!D - 2!S\n\
• 1!H - 2!C - 2!H - 2!S\n\
• 1!H - 2!D - 2!H - 2!S\n\
Reverses are NOT a convention.  If you don't have Game Forcing strength，don't reverse.\n\
