--- Reverse By Responder++ for those that don't play 2/1\n\
Reverses show 5+ cards in the suit opened and 4+ cards in the suit rebid.  They are\n\
Game Forcing.  Possible reverses after 2/1 are...\n\
• 1!D - 2!C - 2!D - 2!H\n\
• 1!D - 2!C - 2!D - 2!S\n\
• 1!H - 2!C - 2!H - 2!S\n\
• 1!H - 2!D - 2!H - 2!S\n\
Reverses by Responder are natural and Game Forcing.  This is NOT a convention.\n\
If you don't have the extra strength，don't reverse.\n\
