Button,1m - 1|2|3 NT,\n\
--- 1m - 1NT，2NT，or 3NT\n\
South opens 1!C or 1!D.  North has any 4333 hand with stuff in every other suit.\n\
Should North skip over a 4-card suit to bid NT?\n\
1NT is 6-10，2NT is 11-12，3NT is 13-15\n\
These deals are leveled so that 1NT，2NT，and 3NT occur at about the same frequency.\n\
These do not use 'Randomly rotate' -- go to Deal source to change it.\n\
