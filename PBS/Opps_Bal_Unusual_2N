# The bidding starts: 1M - P - 2M - P - P
oneS = oS and spades(north)==3 and spades(west)>1
oneH = oH and hearts(north)==3 and hearts(west)>1

# Then, in balancing seat, we get a balancing 2NT

# Define good suits
GoodD = diamonds(west)>3 and top5(west,diamonds)>2
GoodC = clubs(west)>3    and top5(west,clubs)>2

# Intervener is 54 or 45 in the minors -- each requires at least QJT; so, at least 6 HCP for the intervener 
wDC = GoodD and GoodC and shape(west,xx54 +xx45)              // West can have 2 to 4 in openers Major
wRange = losers(west)<8 and hcp(west)<12 and tpWest>hcp(west) // West must start with a Pass

eHand = spades(east)<5 and hearts(east)<5 and tpEast<12    // East must start with a Pass

oSuit = (oneS or oneH) and shape(south,any xxxx-8xxx-7xxx-6xxx)
oRange = hcp(south)>11 and hcp(south)<15 and tpSouth>11 and tpSouth<16
