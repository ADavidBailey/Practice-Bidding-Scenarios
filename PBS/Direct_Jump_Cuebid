Button,Direct Jump Cuebid,\n\
--- Direct Jump Cuebid works differently for a major suit and minor suit.\n\
• 1m (3m) shows an aggressive weak jump overcall w/7+m and 0-10 HCP -- just\n\
as if they had opened any other suit.\n\
• 1M (3M) shows a solid suit (usually a minor) with less than 5 losers and \n\
asks partner to bid 3N with a stopper in the opponent's suit.\n\
