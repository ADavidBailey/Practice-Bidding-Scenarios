Button,Overcalls in 4th??,\n\
--- Overcalls in 4th??  Some hands are too strong for an overcall in 4th seat.\n\
Simple overcalls -- those at the same level as the opening bid -- show\n\
• 7-17 at the 1-level\n\
• 11-17 at the 2-level\n\
With stronger hands，start with a double.  Double then new suit shows 18+.\n\
Overcall then Double is take-out in the 15-17 range.\n\
