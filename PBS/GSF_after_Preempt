# South opens 3H or 3S and North has 3-card support with 1 of the top 3 -- North can see 11, 12, or 13 sure tricks.
southH = hearts(south)>6 and hearts(north)>2 and top3(north,hearts)==1 and losers(north,spades) == 0

# So, if South has 2 of the top 3 in his suit, North can count 13 tricks -- in NT.
# If opener has 1 of the top 3, 12 tricks in the suit are certain.
