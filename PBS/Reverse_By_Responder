--- Reverse By Responder\n\
Reverses show 5+ cards in the suit opened and 4+ cards in the suit rebid.  They show\n\
approximately the same strength as rebidding 2N -- about 17+ HCP.  Possible reverses are...\n\
• 1!C - 1!D - 1N - 2!H or 2!S\n\
• 1!C - 1!H - 1N - 2!S\n\
• 1!C - 1!D - 2!C - 2!H or 2!S\n\
• 1!D - 1!H - 1N - 2!S\n\
• 1!D - 1!H - 2!D - 2!S\n\
Reverses by Responder are natural and Game Forcing.  This is NOT a convention.\n\
If you don't have the extra strength，don't reverse.\n\
