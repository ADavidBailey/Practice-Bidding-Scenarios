--- Reverse By Responder\n\
Reverses by responder show 4+ cards in the first suit and usually 4+ cards in the suit rebid.\n\
They are natural and Game Forcing.  Possible Reverses by Responder are...\n\
• 1!C - 1!D - 1N - 2!H or 2!S\n\
• 1!C - 1!H - 1N - 2!S\n\
• 1!C - 1!D - 2!C - 2!H or 2!S\n\
• 1!D - 1!H - 1N - 2!S\n\
• 1!D - 1!H - 2!D - 2!S\n\
Reverses are NOT a convention.  If you don't have  Game Forcing strength，don't reverse.\n\
