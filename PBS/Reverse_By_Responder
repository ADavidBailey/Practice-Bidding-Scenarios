--- Reverse By Responder\n\
Reverses show 5+ cards in the suit opened and 4+ cards in the suit rebid.  They are\n\
natural and Game Forcing.  Possible reverses are...\n\
• 1!C - 1!D - 1N - 2!H or 2!S\n\
• 1!C - 1!H - 1N - 2!S\n\
• 1!C - 1!D - 2!C - 2!H or 2!S\n\
• 1!D - 1!H - 1N - 2!S\n\
• 1!D - 1!H - 2!D - 2!S\n\
This is NOT a convention.  If you're not Game Forcing，don't reverse.\n\
