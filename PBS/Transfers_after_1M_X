--- Transfer after 1M (X)\n\
Transfers start at 1N and end at 2M-1.\n\
  • 1N  --> 2!C\n\
  • 2!C --> 2!D\n\
  • 2!D --> 2!H\n\
  • 2!H --> 2!S (only after 1S opener)\n\
For transfers into a new suit，responder will have something like a weak 2，or better.\n\
A 1-under jump at the 3-level is a transfer (1!H (X) 3!D，or 1!S (X) 3!H). So，responder has\n\
two ways to raise to the 2- or 3-level. A direct raise is 4-7 and the 1-under jump is 8-10.\n\
With less than invitional values，raise to the limit! 2-level w/3，3-level w/4，or game w/5.\n\
With a fit and invitional+ values (11+)，bid 2NT.\n\
