--- After LHO opening is passed to you...\n\
• Pass\n\
• Overcall a suit (7-17 at the 1-level，11-17 at the 2 level)\n\
• Balancing NT (11-15)\n\
• Take-out Double (10+ short in opener's suit w/at least 3 cards in each unbid suit)\n\
• Jump Overcall (15-17 w/good 6-card suit)\n\
• Too Strong to Overcall (18+) -- start with double\n\
• Two-Suits -- cue bid\n\
• 2NT -- 20-21\n\

This scenario attempts to offer all options (except 2-suits) with about the same frequency.\n\
