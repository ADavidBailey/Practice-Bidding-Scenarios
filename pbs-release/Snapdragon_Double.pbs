Button,Snapdragon Double,\n\
--- Snapdragon Double\n\
After LHO opens，partner overcalls，and RHO bids a new suit，a Snapdragon double\n\
is artifical and forcing.  It shows 5+ cards in the lone unbid suit，at least 8 HCP，\n\
and a tolerance for partner's suit.  'Tolerance' ranges from 2 to 3 cards.\n\
