--- Size Asking Minor Suit Stayman\n\
2!S asks for TOP of range and shows !C or balanced -- Ask yourself，do I want to be in game opposite 8 HCP?\n\
2N is a conditional transfer to !D. You should accept the transfer with better !D than !C; otherwise，bid 3!C.\n\
With a balanced hand，repeated asking bids of 4N and 5N are invites to 6N and 7N.\n\
The opener should treat these as 'Pick a Slam'.\n\
