Button,Resp to a Minor,---  Basic Responses to a Minor Opening\n\
In general，you need 6+ HCP to respond to opener's bid.  When your partner opens in a minor suit\n\
any new suit response is forcing.  Your first priority is the look for a major suit fit.  So bid\n\
a 4-card or longer major.  If you have two major suits，bid the longer first.  If they're equal\n\
length，bid them up the line.  When you don't have a major consider bidding NT.  Note that a NT\n\
response is NOT forcing.  1N would show 6-10 and 2N，11-12.  Without either a major or a hand\n\
suited to NT bid a new minor or raise partner's opening bid.  Click the link below to read about\n\
