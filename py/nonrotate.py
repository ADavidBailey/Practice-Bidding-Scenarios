"""nonrotate.py — resolve a tokenized coaching-curated/<scn>.pbn into the
South=student coaching-non-rotated/<scn>.pbn, folding partner's calls.

The coaching-curated file is rotation-tokenized: every non-pass N/S call has its
own `[BID]` chunk written for its own actor with `@S`/`@v(base|third)` tokens.
The non-rotated file is what bridge-classroom (a literal renderer) reads, so it
fixes South=student and differs in TWO ways:

  1. Tokens are resolved with the trainer's `fill_pronouns` rule — South's calls
     render 2nd person ("You open 1D"), North's render 3rd ("Your partner ...").
  2. Partner's (North's) `[BID]` anchors are FOLDED away: bridge-classroom quizzes
     only the student, so each North chunk is merged into the adjacent South chunk
     and only South's calls keep a `[BID]`. South's auction-ending Pass is anchored
     with `[BID Pass]`.

Fold direction follows who opened (strict N/S alternation in these uncontested
auctions): if North opens (South is responder) each North chunk PREPENDS to the
following South chunk, and a trailing North chunk (partner's final bid that South
passes) becomes a `[BID Pass]` chunk. If South opens, each North chunk APPENDS to
the preceding South chunk.

Run from the project root, then run `bridge_classroom.py <scn>` to strip the
pre-auction stat blocks, renumber, and add [OriginalBoard]:
