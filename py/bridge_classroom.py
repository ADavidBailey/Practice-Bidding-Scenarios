"""Make coaching-non-rotated/*.pbn files compatible with bridge-classroom.com.

bridge-classroom is Rick Wilson's "dumb renderer" teaching platform
(github.com/Rick-Wilson/Bridge-Classroom): it reads a PBN and follows the
embedded coaching directives literally, with no inference. To render cleanly
there, each coached board needs:

  1. No pre-auction ``{...}`` comment blocks.  The ``{Shape ...}``/``{HCP ...}``/
     ``{Losers ...}`` stats and any ``{Curate ...}`` metadata are authoring/curation
     aids the Bridge Play Trainer ignores; bridge-classroom should not see them.
  2. Sequential board numbers.  ``[Board]`` is renumbered 1..n in file order.
  3. The source board number preserved in a separate ``[OriginalBoard]`` tag
     (inserted only if absent, so it captures the number once and survives reruns).
  4. The post-auction coaching ``{...}`` block to open by revealing the student's
     hand.  If the block has no leading ``[show ...]`` directive, ``[show S]`` is
     prepended (matching the hand-tuned model board in Basic_Major.pbn).

The model for the transform is the first board of
``coaching-non-rotated/Basic_Major.pbn``.

The script edits files **in place** under ``coaching-non-rotated/`` and is
idempotent: a second run is a no-op. Run from the project root:

    python3 -P py/bridge_classroom.py              # all *.pbn
    python3 -P py/bridge_classroom.py Basic_Major  # one (with or without .pbn)
    python3 -P py/bridge_classroom.py --check       # dry run, report only

(``-P`` keeps py/'s ``select.py`` from shadowing the stdlib.)
