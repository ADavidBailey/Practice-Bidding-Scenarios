--- Forcing Pass,\n\
Forcing Pass:  When we are in and invitational or better auction and an opponent intervenes, a pass is\n\
forcing.  It shows interest in continuing -- extra offensive values.  A double denies extra offensive\n\
values.  Pass and and then pulling partner's double is stronger that bidding directly.\n\
