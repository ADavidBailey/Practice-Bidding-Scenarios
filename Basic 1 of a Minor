Button,1 Minor Opening,---  Basic 1 Minor Opening\n\
When you don't have a 5+ card major.  You open 1!C or 1!D.\n\
In general，open your longer or higher ranking minor.\n\
Exception:  You only open 1!D with 3 when your distribution is 4=4=3=2.\n\
This means exactly 4!S，4!H，3!D，and 2!C. So，when you're 3-3 in the minors，open 1!C\n\
