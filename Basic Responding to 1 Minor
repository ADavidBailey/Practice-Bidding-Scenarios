In general，you need 6+ HCP to respond to opener's bid.  When your partner opens in a minor suit，any new suit response is forcing.  Your first\n\
priority is the look for a major suit fit.  So bid a 4-card or longer !H or !S suit.  If you have two major suits，bid the longer first.  If\n\
they're equal length，bid the higher ranking.  When you don't have a major consider bidding NT.  Note that a NT response is NOT forcing.  1N would\n\
show 6-10 and 2N 11-12.  Without either a major of a hand suited to NT bid a new minor or raise partner's opening bid.  Click the link below\n\
