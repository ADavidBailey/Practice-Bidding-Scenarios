Button,Ned's 3-Lev 1N Resp (Lev),\n\
---  Ned's 3-Level Response to 1N.\n\
North jumps to 3 or his suit with a good suit and more that 16 HCP.\n\
Without a fit，the opener bids 3N.  With a fit，the opener responds with Key-Cards，skipping around\n\
3N.  If opener does not have a fit，responder can ask for Key-Cards by bidding the first new suit\n\
(4!D when responder's suit is Clubs; otherwise，4!C.  This avoids confusion with any subsequent K-Ask).\n\
