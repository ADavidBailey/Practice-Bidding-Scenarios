Button,1 Notrump Opening,---  1 Notrump Opening\n\
A notrump opening requires balanced hand - 15 to 17 HCP - AND a balanced hand.\n\
Balanced hands include the following distributions: 4333，4432，and 5332.\n\
Many think that a balanced hand with a good 5-card suit should be upgraded by 1 point.\n\
Continuations after 1N are tricky.  Most play Stayman and Jacoby Transfers.  Check out the linked article.\n\
