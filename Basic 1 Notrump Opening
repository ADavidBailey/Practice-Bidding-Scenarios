Button,1 Notrump Opening,---  Basic 1 Notrump Opening\n\
A notrump opening requires 15 to 17 HCP AND a balanced hand.  These include the following\n\
distributions: 4333，4432，and 5332.  Many think that a balanced hand with a good 5-card suit\n\
should be upgraded by 1 point.  Continuations after 1N are tricky.  Most play Stayman and\n\
Jacoby Transfers.  Check out the linked articles.\n\
