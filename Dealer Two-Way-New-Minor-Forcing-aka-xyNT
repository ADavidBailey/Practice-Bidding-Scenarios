Button,2-Way NMF aka xyNT,\n\
---  Two Way New Minor Forcing aka xyNT allows you to describe four different responding hand types.\n\
  • Part Score  -- after 1x-1y-1N，2!H or 2!S and natural and non-forcing.  2N relays to 3!C.\n\
  • Game Invite -- after 1x-1y-1N bid 2C, an artifical relay to 2D.  Then，all continuations are invitational.\n\
  • Game Force  -- after 1x-1y-1N bid 2D, an artifical game force.\n\
  • Slam Invite -- after 1x-1y-1N bid a suit bid at the 3-level is a natural slam try.\n\
The deals are leveled so that the hand types occur at about the same frequency.\n\
