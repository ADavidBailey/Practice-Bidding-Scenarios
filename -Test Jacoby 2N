--- Jacoby 2N\n\
Five different Opening hands can be described after a major suit open and a Jacoby 2N response. The percentages\n\
are the approximate frequency of occurrence for the various hand types. Use the (Leveled) script to even that out.\n\
• 4x (07%) - any strength with a good (5-cards with 2+ of top 3) second suit\n\
• 3x (42%) - any strength with a singleton\n\
• 3M (03%) - 18+ Semi-Balanced\n\
• 3N (12%) - 15-17 Semi-Balanced\n\
• 4M (36%) - 12-14 Semi-Balanced\n\
