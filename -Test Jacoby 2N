--- Jacoby 2N\n\
Five different Opening hands can be described after a major suit open and a Jacoby 2N response. The percentages\n\
are the approximate frequency of occurrence for the various hand types. Use the (Leveled) script to even that out.\n\
• 4x (07%) - any strength with a good (5-cards with 2+ of top 3) second suit\n\
• 3x (42%) - any strength with a singleton\n\
• 3M (03%) - strong hand (16+) with good trumps (2+ of top 3)\n\
• 3N (12%) - strong hand (16+) with so-so trumps\n\
• 4M (36%) - minimum with no shortness\n\
