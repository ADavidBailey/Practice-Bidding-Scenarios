--- After we open 1NT and partner bids Minor Suit Stayman or a Minor Suit Transfer，\n\
minorwood is on: A jump to 4 of the agreed minor is minorwood.  Responses are in steps.\n\
• 1st step is 1 or 4\n\
• 2nd step is 2\n\
• 3rd step is 3\n\
If the Queen has not been shown or denied，then the first non-trump step asks for the Queen;\n\
otherwise，it asks for Kings.\n\
There are multiple ways to play MSS and MST. GIB plays both together，like this:\n\
• 2!S is MSS; then...\n\
    • 3!C - Shows a !C preference.\n\
    • 3!D - Shows a !D preference.\n\
    • 3N - Shows 17 and both minors\n\
• 2N is a MST to !C showing 6+!C\n\
• 3!C is a MST to !D showing 6+!D\n\


--- Stayman asks the opener for a 4-card major.  Responses are as follows:\n\
    - 2!D - No 4-card major\n\
    - 2!H - 4+!H，may also have 4!S\n\
    - 2!S - 4+!S and denies 4!H\n\
Normally，Stayman shows 8+HCP; but，if you're willing to pass anything that your partner\n\
might bid，you may bid 2!C with any strength.\n\
