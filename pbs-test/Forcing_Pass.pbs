--- Forcing Pass: When we are in and invitational or better auction and an opponent\n\
intervenes，a pass is forcing.  It shows extra offensive values and interest in\n\
continuing.  A double denies extra offensive values.  Passing and pulling\n\
partner's double is stronger than bidding directly.\n\
