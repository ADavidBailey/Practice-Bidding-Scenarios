--- Fourth Suit Forcing\n\
After 1!C，1!D，or 1!H，a suit response at the 1-level，and a new suit by\n\
opener，the 4th suit is artificial and game forcing.\n\
NOTE: Many have different agreements about the sequence，1!C - 1!D - 1!H - 1!S.\n\
Some play it as natural and forcing one round.\n\
Some play it as GF and less than 4 spades and use 2!S for GF with 4 spades. Talk to your partner!\n\
