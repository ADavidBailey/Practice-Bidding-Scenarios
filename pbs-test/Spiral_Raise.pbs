After 1m 1M 2M，2N is Spiral asking bid\n\
In the simplest version Opener shows 3- or 4-card support and min/max HCP\n\
• 3!C 3-card support，minimum\n\
• 3!D 3-card support，maximum\n\
• 3!H 4-card support，minimum\n\
• 3!S 4-card support，maximum\n\
Some use a step-bid instead of 2N as the asking bid\n\
