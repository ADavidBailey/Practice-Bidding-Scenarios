--- Inverted Minors\n\
The normal approach to raising partner's minor suit is to raise to 3 with an game invitational hand\n\
and，to raise to 2 with a fit and less than game invitation.  Inverted minors merely reverse these responses.\n\
After an inverted raise to 2，opener should show both majors stopped by bidding 2N.\n\
With only one stopped，bid the stopped suit.  If you intend to continue to 3N，it's OK to deny a stop in the suit that you prefer to be led.\n\
