--- Inverted Minors\n\
NOTE:  Any minor suit raise denies a 4-card major suit.  The normal approach to raising partner's minor suit\n\
is to raise to 3 with a game invitational hand and to raise to 2 with a fit and less than game invitation.\n\
Inverted minors merely reverse these responses.  After an inverted raise to 2，opener should show both\n\
majors stopped by bidding 2N.  With only one stopped，bid the stopped suit.  If you intend to continue to\n\
3N，it's OK to deny a stop in one of the suits -- no specific agreement -- keep 'em guessing.\n\
