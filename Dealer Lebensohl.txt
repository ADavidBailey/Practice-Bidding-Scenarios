After we open 1N and RHO overcalls 2!D，2!H，or 2!S...\n\
  • A suit at the 2-level is natural and not forcing.\n\
  • 2N is a relay to 3C and after the opener's 3C bid...\n\
    ◦ A new suit is to play.\n\
    ◦ A cue bid is Stayman WITH A STOP.\n\
    ◦ 3N is to play WITH A STOP.\n\
  • A new suit at the 3-level is game-forcing.\n\
  • A cue bid is Stayman WITHOUT a stop.\n\
  • 3N is natural and DENIES a STOP -- opener should pass or scramble.\n\
